hyphenator-php
--------
A simple PHP class to hyphenate English sentences mixed with HTML. It originated from http://phphyphenator.yellowgreen.de but it was
not easily configurable and encapsulated. For example it is configured via $GLOBALS variable and pattern matching code looked complex
and ineffective. Actually it was based on a JavaScript implementation of the same algorithm [mnater/Hyphenator](https://github.com/mnater/Hyphenator),
which I have also explained at [my blog](https://nikonyrh.github.io/phphyphenation.html). There also exists a
[heiglandreas/Org_Heigl_Hyphenator](https://github.com/heiglandreas/Org_Heigl_Hyphenator) library which supports many languages
and is a lot more flexible to configure but it does not preserve [HTML tags](http://andreas.heigl.org/2009/04/20/hyphenate-texts-with-php/comment-page-1/#comment-282).

Usage example (after being added to composer.json and installed):

```php
// The used hyphen defaults to HTML '&shy;', any other string is possible as well
$hyphenator = new \NikoNyrh\Hyphenator\Hyphenator('-');

$result = $hyphenator->hyphenate(
    '<hyphenated hyphenated style="hyphenated">hyphenated <hyphenated/> but not &hyphenated;'
)
// '<hyphenated hyphenated style="hyphenated">hy-phen-ated <hyphenated/> but not &hyphenated;'
```

TODO
--------
 - More tests with special characters in UTF-8
 - More languages(?)
 - More optional configurations
